## Methodology
The dataset was obtained from the official [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services website](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub/h-1b-employer-data-hub-files).
This timeseries lineplot was created using the python libraries seaborn and matplotlib and required the merging of 15 different CSV files and additional data cleaning.
