# Data Visualization: Predicting Los Angeles Budget with Gradient Boosted Decision Trees

Hosted notebook is available [on colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iqlMezyD1rOJBr6-OkHf2YEiaGhEilUA).

## Methodology
In this project, I built a machine learning model using the Catboost python library to train Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) to predict the budget of Los Angeles. The model was trained by merging historical budget data with the Schiller Housing Index for Los Angeles, allowing for a deeper understanding of the economic factors influencing the city's financial planning.

### Key Features:
* Data Integration: Combined historical budget data of Los Angeles with the Schiller Housing Index to create a comprehensive dataset for training the model.
* Gradient Boosted Decision Tree: Employed GBDT, a powerful ensemble learning method, for accurate and interpretable predictions of the city's budget.
* Correlation Visualizations: Generated two key visualizations:
  * Correlation matrix to explore relationships between features in the dataset.
  * Feature importance plot to highlight the most influential variables for predicting the budget.

### Project Insights:
The correlation matrix visualization reveals the relationships between different economic indicators and the budget.

The feature importance plot identifies which factors are the most important for the model to make correct predictions.
